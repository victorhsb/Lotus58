# how-to
this is a ABNT2 compatible keymap layout for the Lotus58. Right now i'm using it without the RGB lights (even while using the light rev of the lily58)
its all a bit crappy and i'm really just a begginer on all of this custom keyboard thing so pardon for any errors.

to build this keymap simply copy the folder tqmk_firmware/o `qmk_firmware/keyboards/lily58/keymaps` and run `make lily58/light:lotus58-br`
